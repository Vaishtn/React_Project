        Business case:
        
<p>We are want to introduce digital marketplace for all types of Buyers and sellers across the world</p>

<h4>Target Audience: B2B, B2C customers</h4>

<p>As part of user journey, we identified that we would need a landing page and redirections to showcase all the marketplace features</p>

<h3>Marketplace features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Auctions</li>
<li>products listing</li>
<li>services listing</li>
<li>reverse auctions</li>
<li>host or attend Virtual events/meetings, to share Information on products or services</li>
<li>send/receive - RFI/RFP or Inquiries</li>
</ul>

<br/>
<h3>Design Problems: </h3>
1.Since there are three levels of categories how do we make user navigate from different categories to end up user on desired buying or inquiring products
<br/>
<br/>
2.How do we show case all the features
in landing page in a glance
<br/>
<br/>
3.What would be the field's for Product and services, since they are different
<br/>
<br/>
4. how will user be able to differentiate between products and services visually
<br/>
<br/>
5. In landing page events have a great chance of missing out - how to design to optimize it and make it visible to user


<p>Situation:
We are in Prototyping stage to differentiate between bad and good UI/UX ideas before taking it to development
we are open to all the suggestions and designs which can add value to user or product in terms of usability and value</p>

<h4>What would you need to do?</h4>
1.Understand UI/UX requirements cc
<br/>
<br/>
2.Create the static web pages and redirections for both Mobile and web
<br/>
<br/>
3.Add all micro interactions
<br/>
<br/>
4.Add pagination
<br/>
<br/>
5.Identify improvements in designs and implement in the prototypes
